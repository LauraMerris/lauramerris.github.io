Enjoyed my first 'proper' day back working on the project. I'm still implementing the Axios interceptor to handle refresh and re-request when a bearer token expires.
Currently getting a unhandled promise error, but I'm not sure what is unhandled.

Next steps are to find a better way of error reporting for promises (so I can track down which promise is not handled). I might try and find new resources and examples for using both async/await and then/catch in more complex scenarios.
