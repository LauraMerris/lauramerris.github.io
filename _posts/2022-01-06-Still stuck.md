I'm still stuck on working with interceptors in Axios.  

I know exactly what I need to do, but just can't make my refresh request and token update work.
I gave up today and tried using a library instead of coding it myself, but that's not working either!

Sometimes these things happen, and it's OK. I'm going to switch to working on something different tomorrow, and return to this later in the project.
