Hi, I'm back from my enforced break (otherwise known as scary health scare) with renewed vigor to be alive.

I've been working on moving all my third party api calls to firebase functions, and also moved all firebase calls out into a separate module so that components are separated from whatever back end (Firebase or otherwise), I end up choosing.
